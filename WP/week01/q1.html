		<h1>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</h1>
		<hr> <!-- a horizontal line -->

		<p>
			Whose woods these are I think I <strong>know</strong>.<br>
			His house is in the village <strong>though</strong>;<br>
			He will not see me stopping <strong>here</strong><br>
			To watch his woods fill up with <strong>snow</strong>.<br>
		</p>

		<p>
			My little horse must think it <strong>queer</strong><br>
			To stop without a farmhouse <strong>near</strong><br>
			Between the woods and frozen <strong>lake</strong><br>
			The darkest evening of the <strong>year</strong>.<br>
		</p>

		<p>
			He gives his harness bells a <strong>shake</strong><br>
			To ask if there is some <strong>mistake</strong>.<br>
			The only other soundâ€™s the <strong>sweep</strong><br>
			Of easy wind and downy <strong>flake</strong>.<br>
		</p>

		<p>
			The woods are lovely, dark and <strong>deep</strong>,<br>
			But I have promises to <strong>keep</strong>,<br>
			And miles to go before I <strong>sleep</strong>,<br>
			And miles to go before I <strong>sleep</strong>.<br>
